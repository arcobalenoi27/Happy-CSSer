[Taiji animation (practice after meeting)](http://codepen.io/arcobalenoi27/pen/MmeEVL)

The Taiji animation original code is in the meeting folder.
The Taiji animation pracice after meeting is in the after_meeting folder.
The original one is the Taiji animation I practiced in Happy-CSSer meeting.
And after this meeting, I redo this practice with different approach again.

In 2nd pen, I build the Taiji animation with CSS variable. And I make it can be resized with a CSS  variable called "--radius", so I can change this variable, then the Taiji animation will scale up or down correspondingly.
